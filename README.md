# CCT211 Assignment 1: Regional Business Database GUI

# About:
This application allows you to enter a business' information into the file-accessible Regional Business Database through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

# Requirements:
No version of Python is required to run the .exe file and the file is cross-compatible on any Operating System. The code was written using Python 3.7 and has tkinter implemented, therefore a Python version of at least 3.7 is required to view the .py file with proper compatibility.

# Instructions:
Add a business' information in the corresponding fields and click the [Append to Excel Spreadsheet] button when done. Upon first use, the Excel spreadsheet will automatically be created for you (as "regional_business_database.csv" in the same directory). Please note that due to programming limitations, you have to press tab after the last entry box you edit (known as focusout) to ensure proper updating of information.
